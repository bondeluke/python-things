Class:
    - Encapsulates a concept into a re-usable component.
    - E.g. the Circle class encapsulates the concept of a circle, which can be defined as a point with radius.
Object:
    - An instance of a class.
    - E.g. I can have 2 point objects, say Point(2, 3) and Point(-1, 5). These are two different objects, i.e. 2 different instances of the same class.
Loop:
    - Use for repeating some behavior.
    - Two types of loops: the while-loop and the for-loop
Function:
    - Like a mini program. A function encapsulates behavior.
    - When we use a function, we say that we invoke/call/run the function.
    - A function can input and output.
        - The input to function is generally called the "parameters", or "arguments", of a function
        - The output of a function is generally called the "return value" of the function.
